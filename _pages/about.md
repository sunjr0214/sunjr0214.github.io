Hi, welcome to my academic homepage! I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the School of Computer Science and Technology, [Xidian University](https://cs.xidian.edu.cn/), Xi'an, China. My advisor is Prof. [Lin Gao](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/home/lgao/index.html). Previously, I received my M.S. degree in Software Engineering at [Jiangsu Normal University](http://eit.jsnu.edu.cn/), Xuzhou, China, in 2024.

I am currently focusing on *Bioinformatics*, mainly involving the study of cell type recognition and inter-domain communication in tissues.
Additionally, my research interests also cover: *Clustering Analysis*, *Data Stream Analysis*, and *Big Data Analysis*.
